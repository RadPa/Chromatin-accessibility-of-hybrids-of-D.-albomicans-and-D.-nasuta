# ATACseqQC 
Bioconductor version: Release (3.13) \
R (version "4.1") \

After the alignment of reads to the genome, the unfiltered sorted bam was used for the ATACseqQC. The QC analysis gives information about the library complexity and fragment size distribution across the alignment.
The ATACseqQC.R is the script used for the analysis.
