## Chromatin landscape across two allopatric cross-fertile species
_Drosophila nasuta_ and _D. albomicans_ species of _nasuta_ subgroup of the _immigrans_ species group of _Drosophila_. These two species are morphologically similar, but differ karyotypically; _D. nasuta_ (2n = 8) retains the ancestral karyotype, whereas _D. albomicans_ (2n = 6) has derived fusions of sex and third chromosomes (Ranganath and Hägele, 1981).  

The transmission of sex chromosome is an important evolutionary force that influences many evolutionary ramifications including epigenetic regulation of sex chromosomes and speciation (Meiklejohn and Tao, 2010). Studies have shown that the sex and reproduction related genes evolve rapidly across taxa (Swanson and Vacquier, 2002; Nielsen et al., 2005; Clark et al., 2006; Turner and Hoekstra, 2008). Several studies have shown that new genes in animals tend to be preferentially expressed in male reproductive tissues such as testis (Betrán et al., 2002; Begun et al., 2007; Kaessmann, 2010; Gallach and Betrán, 2011; Gallach et al., 2011; Dubruille et al., 2012). In _Drosophila_ nearly all the duplicated genes are retained and the copy gets a novel function, primarily in testes (Torgerson and Singh, 2004; Assis and Bachtrog, 2013).
